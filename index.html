    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm an SEO Specialist who’s passionate about helping websites grow organically and get found on search engines. I love digging into keyword research, improving content, and finding smart ways to boost rankings and traffic. Whether it’s on-page tweaks, technical audits, or link strategies, I enjoy making data-driven decisions that actually move the needle. Always curious, always learning—especially when Google decides to shake things up!.</p>
